We will provide a function for preprocessing tweets during this week's assignment, but it is still good to know what is going on under the hood. By the end of this lecture, you will see how to use the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org) package to perform a preprocessing pipeline for Twitter datasets."

To help with that, we will be using the [Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)](http://www.nltk.org/howto/twitter.html) package, an open-source Python library for natural language processing. It has modules for collecting, handling, and processing Twitter data, and you will be acquainted with them as we move along the course.\n",

    "The sample dataset from NLTK is separated into positive and negative tweets. It contains 5000 positive tweets and 5000 negative tweets exactly. The exact match between these classes is not a coincidence. The intention is to have a balanced dataset. That does not reflect the real distributions of positive and negative classes in live Twitter streams. It is just because balanced datasets simplify the design of most computational methods that are required for sentiment analysis. However, it is better to be aware that this balance of classes is artificial. \n",
