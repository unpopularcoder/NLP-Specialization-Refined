    "Numpy is one of the most used libraries in Python for arrays manipulation. It adds to Python a set of functions that allows us to operate on large multidimensional arrays with just a few lines. So forget about writing nested loops for adding matrices! With NumPy, this is as simple as adding numbers.\n",
