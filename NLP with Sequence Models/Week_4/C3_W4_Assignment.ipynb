    "\n",
    "Welcome to the fourth assignment of course 3. In this assignment you will explore Siamese networks applied to natural language processing. You will further explore the fundamentals of Trax and you will be able to implement a more complicated structure using it. By completing this assignment, you will learn how to implement models with different architectures. \n",

    "- Learn about Siamese networks\n",
    "- Understand how the triplet loss works\n",
    "- Understand how to evaluate accuracy\n",

    "- Predict using your own model\n",

    "By now, you are familiar with trax and know how to make use of classes to define your model. We will start this homework by asking you to preprocess the data the same way you did in the previous assignments. After processing the data you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether to questions are the same or not. \n",

    "You will process the data first and then pad in a similar way you have done in the previous assignment. Your model will take in the two question embeddings, run them through an LSTM, and then compare the outputs of the two sub networks using cosine similarity. Before taking a deep dive into the model, start by importing the data set.\n"

Several times when teaching I end up responding to similar questions on piazza, or on other community forums. This data set has been labeled for you.
