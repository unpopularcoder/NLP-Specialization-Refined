    "Welcome to the fourth assignment of course 3. In this assignment you will explore Siamese networks applied to natural language processing. You will further explore the fundamentals of Trax and you will be able to implement a more complicated structure using it.

We will start this homework by asking you to preprocess the data the same way you did in the previous assignments. After processing the data you will build a classifier that will allow you to identify whether to questions are the same or not. \n",
