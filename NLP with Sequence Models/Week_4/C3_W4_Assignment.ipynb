    "Welcome to the fourth assignment of course 3. In this assignment you will explore Siamese networks applied to natural language processing. You will further explore the fundamentals of Trax and you will be able to implement a more complicated structure using it. By completing this assignment, you will learn how to implement models with different architectures. \n",
