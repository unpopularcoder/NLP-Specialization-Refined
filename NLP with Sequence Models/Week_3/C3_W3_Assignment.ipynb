    "We first start by defining named entity recognition (NER). NER is a subtask of information extraction that locates and classifies named entities in a text. The named entities could be organizations, persons, locations, times, etc. \n",

    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'ner.png' width=\"width\" height=\"height\" style=\"width:600px;height:150px;\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "- French: geopolitical entity\n",
    "- Morocco: geographic entity \n",
    "- Christmas: time indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything else that is labeled with an `O` is not considered to be a named entity. In this assignment, you will train a named entity recognition system that could be trained in a few seconds (on a GPU) and will get around 75% accuracy. Then, you will load in the exact version of your model, which was trained for a longer period of time. You could then evaluate the trained version of your model to get 96% accuracy! Finally, you will be able to test your named entity recognition system with your own sentence."

    "\n",

    "### Exercise 01\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:** Implement a data generator function that takes in `batch_size, x, y, pad, shuffle` where x is a large list of sentences, and y is a list of the tags associated with those sentences and pad is a pad value. Return a subset of those inputs in a tuple of two arrays `(X,Y)`. Each is an array of dimension (`batch_size, max_len`), where `max_len` is the length of the longest sentence *in that batch*. You will pad the X and Y examples with the pad argument. If `shuffle=True`, the data will be traversed in a random form.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code as an outer loop  \n",
    "```\n",
    "while True:  \n",
    "...  \n",
    "yield((X,Y))  \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Which runs continuously in the fashion of generators, pausing when yielding the next values. We will generate a batch_size output on each pass of this loop.    \n",
    "\n",
    "It has two inner loops. \n",
    "1. The first stores in temporal lists the data samples to be included in the next batch, and finds the maximum length of the sentences contained in it. By adjusting the length to include only the size of the longest sentence in each batch, overall computation is reduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second loop moves those inputs from the temporal list into NumPy arrays pre-filled with pad values.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three slightly out of the ordinary features. \n",
    "1. The first is the use of the NumPy `full` function to fill the NumPy arrays with a pad value. See [full function documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/1.18/reference/generated/numpy.full.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second is tracking the current location in the incoming lists of sentences. Generators variables hold their values between invocations, so we create an `index` variable, initialize to zero, and increment by one for each sample included in a batch. However, we do not use the `index` to access the positions of the list of sentences directly. Instead, we use it to select one index from a list of indexes. In this way, we can change the order in which we traverse our original list, keeping untouched our original list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The third also relates to wrapping. Because `batch_size` and the length of the input lists are not aligned, gathering a batch_size group of inputs may involve wrapping back to the beginning of the input loop. In our approach, it is just enough to reset the `index` to 0. We can re-shuffle the list of indexes to produce different batches each time."
