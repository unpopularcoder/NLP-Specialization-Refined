    "You use autocorrect every day on your cell phone and computer. In this assignment, you will explore what really goes on behind the scenes. Of course, the model you are about to implement is not identical to the one used in your phone, but it is still quite good. \n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment you will learn how to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Get a word count given a corpus\n",
    "- Get a word probability in the corpus \n",
    "- Manipulate strings \n",
    "- Filter strings \n",
    "- Implement Minimum edit distance to compare strings and to help find the optimal path for the edits. \n",
    "- Understand how dynamic programming works\n",

    "- We say two words are n edit distance away from each other when we need n edits to change one word into another. \n",

    "An edit could consist of one of the following options: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Delete (remove a letter): ‘hat’ => ‘at, ha, ht’\n",
    "- Switch (swap 2 adjacent letters): ‘eta’ => ‘eat, tea,...’\n",
